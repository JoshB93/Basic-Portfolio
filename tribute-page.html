        <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p>Born in 1975, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Jonny wasn't exposed to snow for the first few years of his life. In fact, he didn't see snow for the first time until a family holiday to California in 1978. <br> 
        Not long after this, the Moseley family moved to Tiburon - a suburb of San Francisco - where 9 year old Jonny began taking ski lessons.</p>
        <p>By 1992 Moseley was a part of the Squaw Valley Freestyle Ski Team where he quickly won a junior national title. <br> 
        A year later, he graduated from high school and was selected for the U.S. Ski Team - the first Puerto Rican to achieve this accolade.</p>

        <h3>Ski Career</h3>
        <p>His first year after joining the U.S. Ski Team, Moseley failed to qualify for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. Allowing this to drive him forward, Moseley trained hard and qualified for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.</p>
        <p>1998 Ended up being a phenomenal year for Jonny. He won: <ul>
          <li>The first 2 world cup events of the year.</li>
          <li>The gold medal in the mogul skiing at the Olympics.</li>
          <li>The U.S. National mogul skiing title.</li>
          <li>The World Cup Mogul Skiing title with 9 overall wins that season.</li>
          <li>Sportsman of the year - awarded by the U.S. Olympic committee.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>In 1999 Moseley challenged the International Skiing Federation to change its policies to allow athletes to participate in professional events such as the X Games. After his challenge proved successful, Moseley went on to win Silver in the Big Air event.</p>
        <p>In 2000 Moseley won the U.S. Freeskiing Open.</p>

        <h3>Life outside of professional skiing</h3>

        He lives in Squaw valley and can be seen ripping around with his kids as well as taking groups of skiers around the mountain.</p>
        <p>His continuing involvement in the Ski community has led to him featuring in, and becoming a Narrator for many ski segments on the popular youtube Channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl3x43YzlP2RyWCNpOWV2oA" target="_blank">Outside TV</a>. In addition to this, Moseley has starred in and Narrated for warren miller Ski films.</p>
        <p>Following the 2002 Winter Olympics, Jonny hosted Saturday Night Live.</p>
