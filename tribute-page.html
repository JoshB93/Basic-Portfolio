        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>Born in 1975, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Jonny wasn't exposed to snow for the first few years of his life. In fact, he didn't see snow for the first time
           until a family holiday to California in 1978. <br> <br>
           Not long after their vacation, the Moseley family moved to Tiburon - a suburb of San Francisco - where 9 year old Jonny began taking ski lessons.</p>
        <br>
        <p>By 1992 Moseley was a part of the Squaw Valley Freestyle Ski Team (Moguls) where he quickly won a junior national title. <br> 
           A year later, he graduated from high school and was selected for the U.S. Ski Team - the first Puerto Rican to achieve this accolade.</p>

        <h2>Ski Career</h2>
        <p>Having only joined the U.S. Ski Team a year before, Moseley failed to qualify for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. However, he used this to drive him 
           forward and subsequently qualified for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.</p>
        <br>
        <p>1998 Ended up being a phenomenal year for Jonny. He won: 
          <ul>
            <li>The first 2 world cup events of the year.</li>
            <li>Gold in the mogul skiing at the Olympics.</li>
            <li>The U.S. National mogul skiing title.</li>
            <li>The world cup mogul skiing title with 9 overall wins that season.</li>
            <li>Sportsman of the year - awarded by the U.S. Olympic committee.</li>
          </ul>
          Further to these accolades, he also shattered the freestyle world by performing a 360' mute grab in his winning Olympic run.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In 1999 Moseley challenged the International Skiing Federation to change its policies to allow athletes to participate in professional events such as the X Games. After his challenge proved successful, Moseley went on to win Silver in the Big Air event at that years X Games.</p>
        <p>In 2000 Moseley won the U.S. Freeskiing Open.</p>
